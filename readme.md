# My Personal Site

These are the source files for my personal site. If you for whatever reason want to start it yourself, you can run this:

```sh
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
```

It uses the Metalsmith static site generator to convert markdown documents into a website. This is a very minimalistic website without any javascript, and a simple css framework. This framework is a modified version of the bahunya framework.
