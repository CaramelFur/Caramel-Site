# My Personal Site

These are the source files for my personal site. If you for whatever reason want to start it yourself, you can run this:

```sh
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
```

It uses the [Elventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) static site generator, and is deployed to a self hosted Nginx server behind Cloudflare. This is a very minimalistic site with as little Javascript and CSS as possible. The javascript is only used for faster in place navigation, and is therefore not necessary for the site to work. The CSS is running is a modified version of the [Bahunya](https://hakanalpay.com/bahunya/) framework.
