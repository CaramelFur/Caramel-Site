Hey there, I'm Caramel. I'm a software engineer or hacker depending on who you ask. I love messing around with code and electronics to make interesting things.

### Skills

Jumping from one project to another without ever finishing the old one does have its perks. I've picked up a lot of skills along the way. In web dev I'm a full stack developer, backend or frontend in whatever framework or language you need. Though please just use Typescript if you wanted to use Javascript. Low level is also not a problem, I've built plenty of projects around various microcontrollers like the ESP32 or baremetal RPi's. Since I've been busy with microcontrollers, I've also picked up a lot of experience with electronics and PCB design. Besides that I've also been self hosting plenty of my own infrastructure, giving me a lot of experience with Linux, Containers, and Networking. So all summarized: If it's electronics or code, I can probably help you out.

### Projects

I've worked on a lot of projects, but here are some of the more interesting ones:

- **[Picsur](https://picsur.org) ([source](https://github.com/caramelfur/picsur))**: A simple self-hostable image hosting service that I made for myself with built in image conversion and resizing.
- **[Sony-AV-Network-Standby-Enabler](https://github.com/CaramelFur/Sony-AV-Network-Standby-Enabler)**: A project that force enables the network standby feature on Sony AV receivers that don't officially support it. Even though the hardware is capable of it.
- **[FindMy.js](https://github.com/caramelfur/findmy.js)**: A simple library that I made to interact with Apple's FindMy network. As far as I know it's the only one that supports login without 2FA.
- **[StimkerBot](https://github.com/caramelfur/stimkerbot)**: An inline Telegram bot that allows you to tag stickers with text. Making it easier to quickly send the right sticker during a conversation.
- **Tuya/LSC Camera Hack**: A project that enables RTSP streaming on Tuya/LSC cameras without them having to connect to the public internet. This allows you to use them with any NVR or software that supports RTSP.
- **NuggetBot**: A now defunct Imimageage requesting and utility Discord bot that I made initially for my friends, but eventually grew to 100000 Discord servers at its peak.
- **[qoi-stream](https://github.com/caramelfur/qoi-stream)**: A C library that I made to be able to decode and encode QOI image files in a byte-by-byte streaming fashion. This allows for reencoding images with a constant memory usage.
- **[GPhotosShim](https://github.com/caramelfur/gphotosshim)**: A simple android app that proxies intents from the Google Camera app to any generic gallery app. Since the Google Camera app only supports Google Photos, this allows you to use any gallery app you want.
- **Discord-Proxy**: This is a privaty project, since it can be easily misused. But it's a proxy that indistinguishable from the real Discord website, and steals you access token upon login. Both via password, but also via QR login. I just wanted to prove that it can be done much better than those ugly ass sites most account stealers use.
- **[Tetris-NeoMatrix](https://github.com/CaramelFur/Tetris-ESP32-NeoMatrix)**: A reimplementation of Tetris on a 16x16 neopixel screen, using a PS3 controller for input.
- **Tikkie-Decompile**: Another private project, it can/could also be misused. I wanted to see how the Tikkie api worked, so I patched the app to support a custom certificate authority. With this I could d reverse engineer the requests and then make Tikkies without having the app. It also allowed me to make "illegal" Tikkies: Tikkies that never expired, or insanely expensive Tikkies.
- **[Tradfri-Ambilight](https://github.com/CaramelFur/Tradfri-Ambilight)**: A project that creates an "Ambilight" experience using the old Ikea Tradfri gateway and bulbs.
- **Backblaze-Reverse**: A project where I reverse engineered the entire BackBlaze personal backup API, to see if I could create an implementation on Linux. But the API was too complicated for me to bother actually reimplementing it. If someone wants to continue this, hit me up for my findings.
