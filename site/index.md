Hi there, I'm Rubikscraft. If you're visiting this page you've probably come to check out who I am and what I do.

In short, I'm a developer. Yes, thats a vague term, but there simply not a better one for the stuff I do. Basically anything that has to with computers, programming or electronics interests me. So I always find new interesting projects to never fully finish. And since I'm a huge advocate for FOSS, all the stuff I've done so far is published on either my [Github or Gitlab](/info).

Most of what I know now, I've taught myself using the internet. For me its the fastest way learn things, since I can just pick and choose what I need to know at what time. But next to that, I am also working on my bachelors degree in Technical Computer Science at a University of Applied Sciences. Since the sad reality is that many companies still require a degree to work for them.

I also have 2 cats and a dog, and suprisingly they go very well together. Still, the cats are assholes, but thats just cats. At the bottom of this page is a picture of one of them.

Since I prefer to keep my personal information online to a mininum, there is not much more to put here. Also not a suprise then that I dislike big tech companies such as Facebook and Google. Anyways, if you wish to talk for whatever reason, you find my contact info [here](/info).
